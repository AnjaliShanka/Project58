            <p> A cartwheel is a sideways rotary movement of the body. It is performed by bringing the hands to the floor one at a time while the body inverts. The legs travel over the body trunk while one or both hands are on the floor, and then the feet return to the floor one at a time, ending with the athlete standing upright. It is performed in a variety of athletic activities, including performance dance and some types of Indian dance, in gymnastics and cheer, and in the martial arts of capoeira.This was my favourite gymnastic move but there are other more new things that I gotta learn but i have a lot of fun and when I tell my family to do they fail but maybe they will be better later i dont know but its my favourite hobby -> GYMNASTICSðŸ˜œ. </p>
